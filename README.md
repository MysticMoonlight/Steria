# DISCLAIMER

# Steria - The community-made alternative modpack for Minecraft
Steria is the sister project of Kosmos, the community-made Minecraft: Java Edition modpack focused on optimization without PvP features and bloats.

This modpack currently supports from 1.19 to 1.19.2! If the mod says it is not compatible due to minor update, feel free use old version in the meantime.

Also check out our main project [Kosmos](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/Kosmos), the PvP-focused modpack for Minecraft: Java Edition.

**Steria for 1.19.3 is still on beta. Things might not be stable and may subject to change.**
